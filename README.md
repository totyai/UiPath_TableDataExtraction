Extracting data in action: structured information

In the following video demo, we'll help out Jayden with the generation of a report. They work as a Sales Representative and the task for the day is to create a Sales Opportunities report.

The raw data is already available at rpasamples.com/opportunities(opens in a new tab) in the form of a table, but they need to manipulate it further in an Excel file. Instead of copying and pasting each element separately, we'll show Jayden how they can prep their analysis in no time, with the help of the table extraction tool!
