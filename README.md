##Extracting data in action: structured information

In the following video demo, we'll help out Jayden with the generation of a report. They work as a Sales Representative and the task for the day is to create a Sales Opportunities report.

The raw data is already available at rpasamples.com/opportunities(opens in a new tab) in the form of a table, but they need to manipulate it further in an Excel file. Instead of copying and pasting each element separately, we'll show Jayden how they can prep their analysis in no time, with the help of the table extraction tool!

##Extracting data in action: patterns

Now that you've got the hang of the Table Extraction tool, let's see how we can extract data organized in patterns! For this, we'll head over to Corey, a Content Marketing Specialist. They have to analyze the technical content a company has published up to this point in order to evaluate and optimize the content strategy.

The content is available on the Whitepapers webpage(opens in a new tab) of the company, in article form: each post has a title, a description, a category tag, and a thumbnail and is linked to the article page through a URL. Curious how you might translate the pattern into a spreadsheet?
